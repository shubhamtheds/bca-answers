In other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interaction between organisms and their environment. The term “Ecosystem” was first coined by A.G.Tansley, an English botanist, in 1935.</p><h2 id="3c752d95-4a8d-497c-849d-e165c7520da0" class="">Types of Ecosystem</h2><p id="5988127a-3179-480b-a4c5-fa8ea6f67416" class="">An ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an ocean, spanning thousands of miles. There are two types of ecosystem:</p><ul id="ca7232b5-a2da-414e-abc1-3866f7214579" class="bulleted-list"><li>Terrestrial Ecosystem</li></ul><ul id="72ca3423-5a13-4daf-940b-fdf583bb7bff" class="bulleted-list"><li>Aquatic Ecosystem</li></ul><h1 id="f8af1651-4618-44af-a003-bad4ceb45561" class="">Ques 2: What is bioaccumulation?</h1><p id="e94a8c58-3286-4866-ba87-836eed5c76b3" class="">If you have been studying biology for a little while now, then you&#x27;ve learned that you can break down many terms in biology and get a general understanding of the term. So what do you get when you breakdown the term bioaccumulation? Well, you know the word accumulation means the build-up of something and that the prefix bio- means life. Putting it together, you would get the build-up of something in living organisms for the definition of <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>.</p><p id="9d7da097-114d-479e-b492-ab2c0451ba7f" class="">That&#x27;s it, but what&#x27;s building up? Bioaccumulation is used to refer to the build-up of chemicals inside of living organisms. Now we know that certain chemicals are needed and helpful inside of living organisms, so we aren&#x27;t really talking about those; rather, we are talking about the build-up of harmful chemicals.</p><h1 id="2373f117-e13e-42ee-acba-9d70d5e96c98" class="">Ques 3: What do you understand by join forest management?</h1><p id="dcf60f29-5fa1-4d9c-b008-61d526b28f95" class="">Joint forest management (JFM) is a program in which there is partnership between the state forest departments and the local communities that depend upon the forest for their living. It was originated in the early 1970s. It was developed by the environment and forest ministry of Indian Government to develop forest in barren soil. In this, there is one forest protection committee that is in agreement with the forest department. The committee also maintains the balance of ecosystem, protection of climate. There are 22 states that are implementing JFM program.</p><p id="1f88703c-7fff-43a3-8d78-babb818ce81c" class="">

Fixed energy is potential chemical energy bound in various organic substances which can be broken down in order to release their energy content.</p><p id="c81bfab9-b40e-41ea-af61-d7b29b97d922" class="">Organisms that can fix radiant energy utilizing inorganic substances to produce organic molecules are called autotrophs. Organisms that cannot obtain energy from abiotic source but depend on energy-rich organic molecules synthesized by autotrophs are called heterotrophs. Those which obtain energy from living organisms are called consumers and those which obtain energy from dead organisms are called decomposers.</p><p id="b8b94c33-f735-40b5-b25f-b5ef5aa70a8f" class="">When the light energy falls on the green surfaces of plants, a part of it is transformed into chemical energy which is stored in various organic products in the plants. When the herbivores consume plants as food and convert chemical energy accumulated in plant products into kinetic energy, degradation of energy will occur through its conversion into heat. When herbivores are consumed by carnivores of the first order (secondary consumers) further degradation will occur. Similarly, when primary carnivores are consumed by top carnivores, again energy will be degraded.</p><p id="66626dd7-712d-4e77-ae21-6e391722d7c6" class="">
