It is the top line (or gross income) figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income. Revenue is also known as sales on the income statement.</p><p id="6e5bcd5e-9019-40e3-b0a6-29bb37e4c558" class="">Revenue is money brought into a company by its business activities. There are different ways to calculate revenue, depending on the accounting method employed. Accrual accounting will include sales made on credit as revenue for goods or services delivered to the customer.</p><p id="17f149d4-664d-4253-8d09-29cf3ae406ca" class="">It is necessary to check the cash flow statement to assess how efficiently a company collects money owed. Cash accounting, on the other hand, will only count sales as revenue when payment is received. Cash paid to a company is known as a &quot;receipt.&quot; It is possible to have receipts without revenue. For example, if the customer paid in advance for a service not yet rendered or undelivered goods, this activity leads to a receipt but not revenue.</p><h2 id="9e7b89c5-fa2b-4796-b25b-69936d562da5" class="">Question 4: Explain Expenses.</h2><p id="62b13cbf-08ae-4bf9-b8e8-bfc67749e069" class="">An expense is the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate revenue. As the popular saying goes, “it costs money to make money.”</p><p id="1b977c60-c268-45ab-b544-04c062639a78" class="">Common expenses include payments to suppliers, employee wages, factory leases, and equipment depreciation. Businesses are allowed to write off tax-deductible expenses on their income tax returns to lower their taxable income and thus their tax liability. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has strict rules on which expenses businesses are allowed to claim as a deduction.</p><p id="2117d458-7d02-4ae2-8315-45d990261255" class="">One of the main goals of company management teams is to maximize profits. This is achieved by boosting revenues while keeping expenses in check. Slashing costs can help companies to make even more money from sales.</p><p id="af726110-5583-481f-9cbc-2a0370f4b2af" class="">However, if expenses are cut too much it could also have a detrimental effect. For example, paying less on advertising reduces costs but also lowers the company’s visibility and ability to reach out to potential customers.</p><h2 id="c56c908b-683b-44a2-8304-ec1597b1d5f1" class="">Question 5: Write a short note on Capital.</h2><p id="d1f44eba-35c1-47a4-a238-a809885e299f" class="">Capital is a broad term that can describe any thing that confers value or benefit to its owners, such as a factory and its machinery, intellectual property like patents, or the financial assets of a business or an individual. While money itself may be construed as capital is, capital is more often associated with cash that is being put to work for productive or investment purposes.</p><p id="51e0f959-c43c-444f-9c19-e096551b694f" class="">In general, capital is a critical component of running a business from day to day and financing its future growth. Business capital may derive from the operations of the business or be raised from debt or equity financing. When budgeting, businesses of all kinds typically focus on three types of capital: working capital, equity capital, and debt capital. A business in the financial industry identifies trading capital as a fourth component.</p><p id="d6555751-8fd0-4c7b-97cb-5559fbb48eba" class="">From the economists&#x27; perspective, capital is key to the functioning of any unit, whether that unit is a family, a small business, a large corporation, or an entire economy.</p><p id="36b5dc44-2097-4506-be41-216ecaea2de9" class="">Capital assets can be found on either the current or long-term portion of the balance sheet. These assets may include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as well as manufacturing equipment, production facilities, and storage facilities.</p><h2 id="fe4358e3-c426-43e2-a976-ac303acb2499" class="">Question 6: Write a short note on “Cost”.</h2><p id="a1a4dbc8-13cd-442a-905d-a4ac88c46d4b" class="">Cost accounting is a form of managerial accounting that aims to capture a company&#x27;s total cost of production by assessing the variable costs of each step of production as well as fixed costs, such as a lease expense.</p><p id="6fb10316-ce6f-44d0-914b-2b76c05b7fe3" class="">Cost accounting is used by a company&#x27;s internal management team to identify all variable and fixed costs associated with the production process. It will first measure and record these costs individually, then compare input costs to output results to aid in measuring financial performance and making future business decisions. There are many types of costs involved in cost accounting, which are defined below.</p><p id="1f4b5a8c-4dd4-4b2c-9241-d79b7e933178" class=""><strong>Types of Costs</strong></p><ul id="f97a9bff-94ee-45d0-8b22-08d014bffb2b" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Fixed costs are costs that don&#x27;t vary depending on the level of production.</li></ul><ul id="8439e504-535c-4556-a412-3429064fc6de" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Variable costs are costs tied to a company&#x27;s level of production.</li></ul><ul id="9542dc99-57f5-46d3-956d-513f6caa2f94" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Operating costs are costs associated with the day-to-day operations of a business.</li></ul><ul id="54a84c52-54b5-4e3e-a623-e3bae45100e0" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Direct costs are costs specifically related to producing a product.</li></ul><ul id="f8332af9-ec10-456b-865a-124d2ad7947d" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Indirect costs are costs that cannot be directly linked to a product.</li></ul><h2 id="df0391d2-1521-487c-b3cc-9d5ed6bfe070" class="">Question 7: What is drawing?</h2><p id="ff79e499-40ff-4598-a277-a61df9400425" class="">A drawing account is an accounting record maintained to track money withdrawn from a business by its owners. A drawing account is used primarily for businesses that are taxed as sole proprietorships or partnerships. Owner withdrawals from businesses that are taxed as separate entities must generally be accounted for as either compensation or dividends.</p><p id="204887d9-0222-45d0-b160-8f2fc203954e" class="">A drawing account is a contra account to the owner’s equity. The drawing account’s debit balance is contrary to the expected credit balance of an owner&#x27;s equity account because owner withdrawals represent a reduction of the owner&#x27;s equity in a business. In keeping with double-entry bookkeeping, every journal entry requires both a debit and a credit. Because a cash withdrawal requires credit to the cash account, an entry that debits the drawing account will have an offsetting credit to the cash account for the same amount.</p><p id="e47e23e7-ad59-4e8d-a8bb-a7a3559c30b8" class="">Since the drawing account tracks distributions to owners in a given year, it must be closed out at the end of the year with a credit (representing the total withdrawn) and the balance is transferred to the main owner’s equity account with a debit. The drawing account is then re-opened and used again the following year for tracking distributions. Because taxes on withdrawals are paid by the individual partners, there is no tax impact to the business associated with the withdrawn funds.</p><h2 id="8c55696a-c732-48e4-b097-b81bfc12885e" class="">Question 8: Define “Financial Accounting”.</h2><p id="c794fb70-508a-42cd-9f70-f91fa3ac18e1" class="">Financial accounting is a specific branch of accounting involving a process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the myriad of transactions resulting from business operations over a period of time. These transactions are summarized in the preparation of financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, that record the company&#x27;s operating performance over a specified period.</p><p id="4a68cf99-5f29-4307-96a8-ec0a921cd5ff" class="">Work opportunities for a financial accountant can be found in both the public and private sectors. A financial accountant&#x27;s duties may differ from those of a general accountant, who works for himself or herself rather than directly for a company or organization.</p><p id="05e46e62-1ee2-4d62-808d-fe9cf3385e69" class="">The financial statements used in financial accounting present the five main classifications of financial data: revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity. Revenues and expenses are accounted for and reported on the income statement. They can include everything from R&amp;D to payroll.</p><h2 id="557d2bdf-472f-43da-9d57-f5d4c70c7480" class="">Question 9: Write a short note on “Net Profit”.</h2><p id="8f70b596-3c30-4c74-acf0-951dbaf074ae" class="">Net profit is the result after all expenses have been subtracted from revenues. This figure is the aggregate result of all operating and financing activities of an organization. As such, it is routinely relied upon by investors, creditors, and lenders to make decisions about how to deal with a firm. Net profit is also called the bottom line, because it is positioned at the bottom of the income statement.</p><p id="7f96e66a-dfaa-4d8b-8768-18428e06fa8c" class="">To calculate net profit, subtract the cost of goods sold, operating expenses, financing costs, and tax costs from net revenues. The calculation is as follows:</p><p id="e78cc5bb-784a-4ba2-a6e0-dcf6ba89e648" class=""><code>Net revenues - Cost of goods sold - Operating expenses - Financing costs - Tax costs = Net profit</code></p><p id="0a20d6a0-d8c9-46dd-878c-180582886b0a" class=""><strong>Net Profit vs. Net Cash Flow</strong></p><p id="f5c94d13-fc73-4a72-b716-db6438cca6f6" class="">Net profit is not the same as net cash flows, which appears in the statement of cash flows. Differences between net profit and net cash flows include timing issues related to accrual-basis accounting and the reduction of cash flows caused by expenditures for fixed assets.</p><h2 id="b7ec27aa-2506-4ee2-80ab-cc31fd848e77" class="">Question 10: Explain fund.</h2><p id="af4c4b8e-95cd-42f3-839c-cc3b64100e37" class="">A fund is a pool of money that is allocated for a specific purpose. A fund can be established for many different purposes: a city government setting aside money to build a new civic center, a college setting aside money to award a scholarship, or an insurance company that setts aside money to pay its customers’ claims.</p><p id="4320e959-c990-48e3-b393-6fb371dfde86" class="">Individuals, businesses, and governments all use funds to set aside money. Individuals might establish an emergency fund—also called a rainy-day fund—to pay for unforeseen expenses or a trust fund to set aside money for a specific person.</p><p id="8f79347d-b934-4be5-a71c-ebb0789616fa" class="">Individual and institutional investors can also place money in different types of funds with the goal of earning money. Examples include mutual funds, which gather money from numerous investors and invest it in a diversified portfolio of assets, and hedge funds, which invest the assets of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) and institutions in a way that is designed to earn above-market returns. Governments use funds, such as special revenue funds, to pay for specific public expenses.</p><blockquote id="958aa87d-80c9-42de-a48c-e622576cbaa0" class=""><mark class="highlight-teal_background">Section B</mark></blockquote><h2 id="31df2c76-23b2-4279-8df1-3408c78c0dbb" class="">Question 11: Discuss the role and activities of an accountant.</h2><p id="78bb87e9-8c51-427c-97c3-3878850a6558" class="">The main role of an accountant is to collect, analyze, record and report the financial data of a company or an individual.

Accrual accounting is one of two accounting methods; the other is cash accounting. Cash accounting only records the revenue when the cash transaction has occurred for the goods and services.</p><ul id="ccb36379-43be-44d8-ad25-b48f9d0b91ef" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Accrual accounting is an accounting method where revenue or expenses are recorded when a transaction occurs versus when payment is received or made.</li></ul><ul id="1e8dfe97-c6d6-4248-8122-88afb5b2f61d" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The method follows the matching principle, which says that revenues and expenses should be recognized in the same period.</li></ul><ul id="dd4f5e5d-6d0b-4b7a-9c6e-7f7e4359ca47" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Cash accounting is the other accounting method, which recognizes transactions only when payment is exchanged.</li></ul><p id="eaa06810-7a26-4337-bc4d-75e94dfed33f" class="">The general concept of accrual accounting is that economic events are recognized by matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time when the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made or received. This method allows the current cash inflows or outflows to be combined with future expected cash inflows or outflows to give a more accurate picture of a company&#x27;s current financial position.</p><h3 id="d7b8fab3-0baf-4d58-8fab-a56bc91b1032" class="">Qualifying for Accrual Accounting</h3><p id="d93277ec-a1e8-499c-acc1-db6d03f6ec41" class="">Accrual accounting is considered the standard accounting practice for most companies except for very small businesses and individuals. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows qualifying small businesses to choose their preferred method. Companies can use the accrual method of accounting if their revenue is below a specific threshold set by the IRS called the gross receipts method.</p><p id="1457c74a-440e-4db7-ac4f-9fb4683808a6" class="">A corporation or partnership meets the gross receipts test for any taxable year if the average annual gross receipts for the 3-taxable-year period ending with the taxable year, which precedes such taxable year, does not exceed $26 million in 2021 and $27 million in 2022.</p><h3 id="1a6bad13-9fc9-40ed-b6c0-91a0408a4d34" class="">Benefits of Accrual Accounting</h3><p id="f12dfc7c-cc96-41e9-9b1f-502640157910" class="">The accrual method does provide a more accurate picture of the company&#x27;s current condition, but its relative complexity makes it more expensive to implement.</p><p id="03701357-4d89-4fa6-af4e-9865ad02a401" class="">This method arose from the increasing complexity of business transactions and a desire for more accurate financial information. Selling on credit, and projects that provide revenue streams over a long period, affect a company&#x27;s financial condition at the time of a transaction. Therefore, it makes sense that such events should also be reflected in the financial statements during the same reporting period that these transactions occur.</p><p id="be68c114-ff36-4392-a722-922b56659ee8" class="">Under accrual accounting, firms have immediate feedback on their expected cash inflows and outflows, making it easier for businesses to manage their current resources and plan for the future.</p><h2 id="1f4af072-cf2c-40dd-8789-423947546ba7" class="">Accrual Accounting vs. Cash Accounting</h2><p id="e6eeade9-93dd-4f4c-b6ba-a5a7920295f1" class="">Accrual accounting can be contrasted with cash accounting, which recognizes transactions only when there is an exchange of cash. Accrual accounting is almost always required for companies that carry inventory or make sales on credit.</p><p id="220beaa0-8975-4912-a8f6-8e3d54fea69e" class="">For example, consider a consulting company that provides a $5,000 service to a client on Oct. 30. The client received the bill for services rendered and made a cash payment on Nov. 25. The accounting entry would be recorded differently under the cash versus the accrual method.</p><h3 id="c49b8120-a965-4e57-bb61-fd0c372d589c" class="">Cash Method</h3><p id="f5200eb0-9918-4fab-be86-9fd94bc1572d" class="">The revenue generated by the consulting services will only be recognized under the cash method when the company receives payment. As a result, if the company uses the cash accounting method, the $5,000 in revenue would be recorded on Nov. 25, which is when the company receives the payment.</p><h3 id="9bb7493a-3bc1-428d-b169-7bd7ee578fbd" class="">Accrual Method</h3><p id="c7170d2f-fca5-4783-b574-7ba9382c10aa" class="">However, accrual accounting says that the cash method is not accurate because it is likely, if not certain, that the company will receive the cash at some point in the future because the services have been provided.</p><h3 id="1813e452-c002-49f4-be51-ef7a3126b64f" class="">Types of Accrual Accounts?</h3><p id="6de10c2b-131d-472f-8290-146f8a109319" class="">There are various types of accrual accounts. The most common include accounts payable, accounts receivable, goodwill, accrued interest earned, and accrued tax liabilities.</p><p id="9858032f-4ec6-4ac2-8f1d-4927516bd8e7" class="">Accounts payable refers to debts a company incurs when it receives goods or services from its vendors before it has actually paid for them. Using the accrual accounting method, when a company incurs an expense, the debt is recorded on the balance sheet as an accounts payable liability and the income statement as an expense.</p></div></article></body></html>
